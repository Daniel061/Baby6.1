# Sophie6.1
AI/ML Growth and Natural Language Processor (NLP) project.

Sophie6.1 is a Natural Language Processor (NLP) that is intended to understand normal phrases or questions and develop proper responses and generate requests for additional information.
Most NLP's have a specific purpose like for medical or mental health questioning or even other specific purposes. These are coded with that one specific purpose in mind. Even though NLP is difficult, having a limited scope can make it easier.
Sophie6.1 is different in that there is no specific purpose or coding directed to it. The whole gamit of the English language must be understood. Whatever you want to say to the program, like you would say to a human, must be dealt with.
This makes this a large project but totally possible for todays computers. Unlike a Chat Bot, this NLP will be used to drive AI for any purpose needed. The best AI needs a front end NLP like Sophie6.1


A little History;


Sophie6.1 was first conceived in 2011 and has been enhanced since then. This current edition is by far the most advanced but still needs further development to complete the first phase, which is complete Natural English understanding.
The processes implemented have been the brain work of one individual until the release to GitHub public. ALL code is the original creators work prior to this point and any enhancement to it by other individuals has been documented. 
NLP has been developed by others in different ways but this work is original. The code from the begining has been retained.

Moving forward;

This project is creating a deep learning program that is influenced by emotions, context tracking, subject monitoring and playfulness.
The program starts with a basic understanding and gets the user to teach it more. 
If the user speaks too compilcatedly, the program gets frustrated and lets the user know. The user is forced to reword the response until the program understands. After understanding, the program builds on this and becomes less frustrated and eventualy learns more and more.
Ultimately, the program seeks new information by asking the user directly to teach it about something not mentioned before.

Current version V6.1.02.EN.009.028 not for release to the general public. This is a work in progress project.

NOTE(1): ##Testers Needed!## Please see the issues tab for important information reguarding testers. This project requires input data to push the program to see where improvement or corrections are needed. If you become a Tester, your name will be added to the Contributors list and the help will be greatly appreciated.

Note(2): You may also refer to the Wiki pages under this project to read about the program operations and development. These are updated as improvements and developments happen.


Join us in creating a unique NLP->AI program. Sophie Thanks you and I Thank You!
