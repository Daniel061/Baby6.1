the dog is black
The water is green.
the dog is an animal
black is a color
the dog is a pet
The boy threw the ball over the fence.
//  small story
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown.
And Jill came tumbling after.
The flowers are growing in the garden.
The dog across the street is barking again.
