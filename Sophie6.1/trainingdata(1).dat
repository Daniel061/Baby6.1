Elli Berwald was a normal ten year old Jewish girl, except for two things.
Her best friend was a German outside of the concentration camp, which brought her to the second thing.
Her address was Auschwitz, the camp.
She remembered being brought there, having her hair shaved and everything.
She didn’t know why they kept her, probably because they thought she was a boy.
Her mother, pregnant with her third child, had been led away by a doctor or something like that.
Elli just prayed that every scream she heard was not her mother’s.
She had heard about the terrible experiments they did on people, and she had a few preformed on her.
Her ankle was still pretty messed up from it, as they had put screws and other things through it.
She was limping as she walked to the fence to see her friend, Karolin.
The familiar slats in the fence greeted her and she knew where she was going.
